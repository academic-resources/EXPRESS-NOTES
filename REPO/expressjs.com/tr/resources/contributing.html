      <p>The goal of this guide is to create a contribution process that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Encourages new contributions.</li>
        <li>Encourages contributors to remain involved.</li>
        <li>Avoids unnecessary processes and bureaucracy whenever possible.</li>
        <li>
          Creates a transparent decision making process which makes it clear how
          contributors can be involved in decision making.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This document is based on much prior art in the Node.js community,
        io.js, and the Node.js project.
      </p>
      <p>Vocabulary:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A <strong>Contributor</strong> is any individual creating or
          commenting on an issue or pull request.
        </li>
        <li>
          A <strong>Committer</strong> is a subset of contributors who have been
          given write access to the repository.
        </li>
        <li>
          A <strong>TC (Technical Committee)</strong> is a group of committers
          representing the required technical expertise to resolve rare
          disputes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="logging-issues">Logging issues</h3>
      <p>
        Log an issue for any question or problem you might have. When in doubt,
        log an issue, any additional policies about what to include will be
        provided in the responses. The only exception is security dislosures
        which should be sent privately.
      </p>
      <p>
        Committers may direct you to another repository, ask for additional
        clarifications, and add appropriate metadata before the issue is
        addressed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please be courteous, respectful, and every participant is expected to
        follow the project’s Code of Conduct.
      </p>
      <h3 id="contributions">Contributions</h3>
      <p>
        Any change to resources in this repository must be through pull
        requests. This applies to all changes to documentation, code, binary
        files, etc. Even long term committers and TC members must use pull
        requests.
      </p>
      <p>No pull request can be merged without being reviewed.</p>
      <p>
        For non-trivial contributions, pull requests should sit for at least 36
        hours to ensure that contributors in other timezones have time to
        review. Consideration should also be given to weekends and other holiday
        periods to ensure active committers all have reasonable time to become
        involved in the discussion and review process if they wish.
      </p>
      <p>
        The default for each contribution is that it is accepted once no
        committer has an objection. During review committers may also request
        that a specific contributor who is most versed in a particular area
        gives a “LGTM” before the PR can be merged. There is no additional “sign
        off” process for contributions to land. Once all issues brought by
        committers are addressed it can be landed by any committer.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case of an objection being raised in a pull request by another
        committer, all involved committers should seek to arrive at a consensus
        by way of addressing concerns being expressed by discussion, compromise
        on the proposed change, or withdrawal of the proposed change.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a contribution is controversial and committers cannot agree about how
        to get it to land or if it should land then it should be escalated to
        the TC. TC members should regularly discuss pending contributions in
        order to find a resolution. It is expected that only a small minority of
        issues be brought to the TC for resolution and that discussion and
        compromise among committers be the default resolution mechanism.
      </p>
      <h3 id="becoming-a-committer">Becoming a committer</h3>
      <p>
        All contributors who land a non-trivial contribution should be
        on-boarded in a timely manner, and added as a committer, and be given
        write access to the repository.
      </p>
      <p>
        Committers are expected to follow this policy and continue to send pull
        requests, go through proper review, and have other committers merge
        their pull requests.
      </p>
      <h3 id="tc-process">TC process</h3>
      <p>
        The TC uses a “consensus seeking” process for issues that are escalated
        to the TC. The group tries to find a resolution that has no open
        objections among TC members. If a consensus cannot be reached that has
        no objections then a majority wins vote is called. It is also expected
        that the majority of decisions made by the TC are via a consensus
        seeking process and that voting is only used as a last-resort.
      </p>
      <p>
        Resolution may involve returning the issue to committers with
        suggestions on how to move forward towards a consensus. It is not
        expected that a meeting of the TC will resolve all issues on its agenda
        during that meeting and may prefer to continue the discussion happening
        among the committers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Members can be added to the TC at any time. Any committer can nominate
        another committer to the TC and the TC uses its standard consensus
        seeking process to evaluate whether or not to add this new member.
        Members who do not participate consistently at the level of a majority
        of the other members are expected to resign.

          >
          for the bug you want to fix or the feature that you want to add.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create your own
          <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/express">fork</a> on github,
          then checkout your fork.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write your code in your local copy. It’s good practice to create a
          branch for each new issue you work on, although not compulsory.
        </li>
        <li>
          To run the test suite, first install the dependencies by running
          <code>npm install</code>, then run <code>npm test</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the tests pass, you can commit your changes to your fork and then
          create a pull request from there. Make sure to reference your issue
          from the pull request comments by including the issue number
          e.g. #123.

      <h3 id="issues-which-are-questions">Issues which are questions</h3>
      <p>
        We will typically close any vague issues or questions that are specific
        to some app you are writing. Please double check the docs and other
        references before being trigger happy with posting a question issue.
      </p>
      <p>Things that will help get your question issue looked at:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Full and runnable JS code.</li>
        <li>Clear description of the problem or unexpected behavior.</li>
        <li>Clear description of the expected result.</li>
        <li>Steps you have taken to debug it yourself.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you post a question and do not outline the above items or make it

        The Express team and community take all security bugs in Express
        seriously. Thank you for improving the security of Express. We
        appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every
        effort to acknowledge your contributions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Report security bugs by emailing the lead maintainer in the Readme.md
        file.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lead maintainer will acknowledge your email within 48 hours, and
        will send a more detailed response within 48 hours indicating the next
        steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report,
        the security team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress
        towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional
        information or guidance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team
        maintaining the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the
        <a href="https://nodesecurity.io/report">Node Security Project</a>.

      <h3 id="disclosure-policy">Disclosure Policy</h3>
      <p>
        When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign
        it to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release
        process, involving the following steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.</li>
        <li>Audit code to find any potential similar problems.</li>
        <li>
          Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes
          will be released as fast as possible to npm.
        </li>
      </ul>
